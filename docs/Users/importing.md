# Importing from other password managers

Requests for adding an import mechanism inside of APS itself have come up every so often, but we've refrained from considering it for multiple reasons. If you find yourself in a situation where you do require the ability to import passwords from a different password manager such as Google Passwords or KeePassXC, take a look at [pass-import]. It supports **way** more password managers than we ever could, just needs Python to run, and is actively maintained.
