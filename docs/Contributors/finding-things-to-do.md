# Finding ways to contribute

As a newcomer to the APS repository, it can be daunting to make your first contribution. Fret not, we're here to help!

Thanks to an extensive [labelling system] used in the repository, you can filter things relevant to your interests based on parameters like what part of the app they affect or how much effort fixing a particular issue is expected to take.

If you're still unable to find something, ask us! We have a [discussions] section in the repository where you can post any such questions and we'd be happy to show you around the source code and find something you'd like to work on.

If you don't want to write code, that's even better! Password Store's documentation is in a rather sad state, and user contributed documentation will go a long way in fixing that. Send a PR to the [docs] repository adding a new page on a topic that's not already covered and we'd be more than happy to accept your contribution.
